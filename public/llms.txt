> AI-powered software engineer interview coaching platform

## What We Do

Apex Interviewer is an AI interview coach that helps software engineers pass technical interviews at Google, Meta, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Netflix, OpenAI, Anthropic, and other top tech companies.

## Key Features

- **AI Mock Interviews**: Realistic coding, system design, and behavioral interview simulations
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Instant evaluation of code correctness, communication clarity, and soft skills
- **Company-Specific Rubrics**: Calibrated to how Google, Meta, Amazon, and other companies actually evaluate candidates
- **Verified Questions**: Real questions from actual tech interviews, not made-up problems
- **Progress Tracking**: Dashboard showing improvement across all interview dimensions

## Who We Help

- Software engineers preparing for FAANG/MAANG interviews
- Developers who keep failing coding interviews despite knowing the material
- Engineers who struggle with communication during technical interviews
- Anyone preparing for system design or behavioral interviews

## How We're Different

Unlike LeetCode or HackerRank (which only test if you can solve problems), we simulate the complete interview experience with follow-up questions, communication evaluation, and company-specific scoring.

Unlike human coaches ($200-400/session), we offer unlimited 24/7 practice with instant AI feedback.
